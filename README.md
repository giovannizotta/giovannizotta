### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### About me
After graduating from the University of Trento with a **Master's Degree in Computer Science**, I moved to Amsterdam to work as a Java developer at Picnic Technologies.
My main interests are in Distributed Systems and Algorithms, although I'm also into Performance Evaluation, Virtualization and Cloud Computing.
