### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### About me
I got my Master's in Computer Science in 2022, after which I moved to Amsterdam to work as a Software Engineer for [Picnic](https://github.com/PicnicSupermarket) in the Warehouse Systems team, primarily using Java, Spring, SQL, RabbitMQ, Python. I'm passionate about many technical topics, like distributed systems, databases, protocols, and API design. I also like to play with other languages like Go when I have the opportunity.

I joined Booking.com in late 2024, working in the Fintech domain.
